# AI Visual App

This react-native based app is a demonstration and walkthrough of how Dijkstra's and A Start pathfinding algorithm works. It shows each step from the start to finding the end node. It labels the nodes and connections by color so one can easily identify what is going on at the current moment.

## *IMPORTANT*  
The app is meant to be viewed through a horizontal orientation. I have not found a way for snack.expo to allow the rotation of the phone so the workaround for that is to click on the "Web" button and then click on the "Export Symbol" right next to it. This way you can adjust the size of the new windows to fit a landscape view and the app should work as intended.

Also, clicking on the node to show its heuristic value for the A* algorithm does not work on web in this demonstration, but does on the original app.
